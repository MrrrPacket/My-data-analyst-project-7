# My-data-analyst-project-7
A project was carried out to research and analyze popular topics in the corpus of comment texts from YouTube videos. An assessment of the level of illumination of problems from the field of Russian fintech was presented. 
Marking up topics with tokens allowed us to train a tree for subsequent marking up of the remaining database.
In parallel to the project, dataframes were formed, which were further analyzed by means of descriptive statistics with the output of graphs, histograms, etc.
Later, hypotheses were made for individual variables, the type was identified and a suitable method of analysis was used (Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman, or Chi-squared).
